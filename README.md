## Methods for working with localStorage, SimpleLightbox library and Vimeo Player API
The project is assembled using the parcel.
Here we will discuss the main methods of working with local storage.

• **images gallery** Using the package manager for JavaScript ```npm```, the SimpleLightbox library is installed.

• **video player**:
1. Added Vimeo libraries as a project dependency via npm.
2. Saved playback time to local storage.
3. When reloading the page, resume playback from the saved position.
4. The lodash.throttle library was added to the project and made so that the playback time is updated in the repository no more than once per second.
                   
• **feedback form** Created a script that saves field values to local storage when the user types something.
